        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><p>Having learned English passively for many years in preparation for exams, I still feel my proficiency is quite limited. Recently, I have  made a conscious effort to improve, and I would like to share some of my experiences and feelings here.</p><h2 id="Feelings"><a href="#Feelings" class="headerlink" title="Feelings"></a>Feelings</h2><p>I came across the <em>Magic Tree House</em> series through a helpful video recommendation. Excited by how useful it seemed, I immediately placed an order online. After eagerly awaiting their arrival, I received the first four books of the series and started reading them right away. It took me about two weeks to finish, which felt rewarding. Here are my feelings:</p><h3 id="1-So-many-pretty-common-verbs-and-nouns-that-I-do-not-know-at-all"><a href="#1-So-many-pretty-common-verbs-and-nouns-that-I-do-not-know-at-all" class="headerlink" title="1. So many pretty common verbs and nouns that I do not know at all"></a>1. So many pretty common verbs and nouns that I do not know at all</h3><p>There were many common verbs and nouns that are used in everyday life, but I had never learned them. For example, nouns like oak tree, rope ladder, bush, and porch, and verbs like peer, crawl, tiptoe, and frown—these are simple, everyday words, yet I was unfamiliar with their meanings, which meant I had to spend a lot of time looking them up while reading.</p><p>I guess the reason is that I used to learn English from textbooks written by Chinese teachers, many of whom had likely never been abroad. The content was far removed from authentic, natural English. To make matters worse, I spent so much time doing drills just to get good grades on exams, which meant what I learned was not even proper, everyday English. On top of that, I rarely used English in my daily life. It could not have been worse!</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="2-Grammar-is-quite-easy-for-me"><a href="#2-Grammar-is-quite-easy-for-me" class="headerlink" title="2. Grammar is quite easy for me"></a>2. Grammar is quite easy for me</h2><p>As I mentioned earlier, I used to practice a lot for exams, which helps me become familiar with most English grammar rules. As a result, it is so easy for me to understand the grammar in <em>Magic Tree House</em> series. It is common for English learners in the Chinese school system to excel in grammar and exams but have little exposure to authentic spoken or written English.</p><h2 id="3-This-series-of-books-is-both-interesting-and-hugely-useful"><a href="#3-This-series-of-books-is-both-interesting-and-hugely-useful" class="headerlink" title="3. This series of books is both interesting and hugely useful"></a>3. This series of books is both interesting and hugely useful</h2><p>The adventures of main characters are truly magical and captivating. Annie brave and imaginative, while Jack is smart and eager to learn things. Each place they visit feels like a fantastic journey. And the most import is, I have learned so much from it. The series is full of natural words and expressions describing the characters’ actions, emotions, historical figures, and the natural world, which has helped improve my English significantly.</p><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>This series is very useful and perfectly  match my current level,  and I plan to continue reading other books in this series. My English learning plan now is to immerse myself in the language as much as possible, learning like a native child would—by reading, watching, and listening to authentic English content. And I will share my process here regularly.</p><h1 id="Appendix"><a href="#Appendix" class="headerlink" title="Appendix"></a>Appendix</h1><p>My current  vocabulary:</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center">Reading vocabulary</th><th align="center">Listening vocabulary</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">5000</td><td align="center">4500</td></tr></tbody></table>]]></content>
